# Consensus

Consensus is the key feature that allows Dw3ll to arrive at accurate, verified information.&#x20;

Previous systems like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap have shown that large, distributed teams of volunteers can produce highly accurate and trustworthy information. Once information is used for financial transactions, there's an incentive for even mildly compromised people to be tempted to add innacurate information for their own gain. Cryptocurrencies only became possible once trustless consensus protocols were invented that made it impossible for users to cheat the system.

Dw3ll relies on a simple consensus system that is trustless and decentralized.

Anyone can add or update information about a home and receive a small fee for their contribution.

Users who want confidence the information has a higher level of trust and verification can propose a bounty on a home. Contributors can then bond their tokens in response to show they have high trust in at home's information. Over time the bonded tokens are released back to the bonders and they receive the bounty in return for their risk and verification.

Anyone can trigger a dispute on a piece of information that is adjudicated by a time delay and full vote of the holders.

Different levels of accuracy and verification are needed for different uses of the information. So what one user is willing to pay a few cents to verify, another user may be willing to pay a few hundred dollars to verify. The higher the bounty, the higher the incentive for contributors to go out of their way to verify the information and bond their tokens.
