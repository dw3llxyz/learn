# Home Info

Our homes are all different shapes and sizes and styles. They have histories over months or years or centuries. All of that gives the home its character and adds variety to our neighborhoods. Like the color of the paint or the style of the roof, the details about our homes and neighborhoods is all visible to the public eye and should be easy for anyone to find and learn from.

Dw3ll is an open record of all the public information about homes and properties in the world. It's created by the world community working together to make our public records open and available. We follow the rich tradition of community driven, public information sites like [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

Here are some examples of the kind of information available in Dw3ll:

* Address
* GPS Location
* Government Property Record Number (Parcel # in the US)
* Number of Stories
* Year Built
* Land area
* Historical Sale Prices
* Current and Past Owners

Dw3ll uses a unique consensus mechanism to incentivize verifiably correct and accurate data that's kept up to date. It relies on a community of contributors to help provide information from public records and their own observations made while out in the world. People and companies that are interested in using the data can make requests for information to recieve extra verification.
